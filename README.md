# CSC360-aodenike-Setup

This project is an nqueen solver.

To run this program go to sortingLibrary.java
Modify the main function at the bottom to call nQueenStarter() passing in the n value you wish
The program will print out both how many solutions it found and arrays of the solutions showing each line and where the queen is on that line.
The program takes longer for higher n values, values 14 and above are not recomended.
